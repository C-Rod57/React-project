# Welcome to my final React Project

## My react app was deployed to https://C-Rod57.github.io/React-project

### My app is very simple and to be honest, doesn't look that great. I blame my lack of CSS knowledge for that one. The app has 5 react components: A Doomsday Countdown, a To-do list, a button to change the color of a part of the screen, an accordion component that contains text, and a table that reacts to a hovering mouse.
